--1 and 4: The data elements to be used in the example

data  Data=   Data Int String
 
              deriving (Read, Show)

--3 The mappings between the cache and the phisical storage are defined by the interface IResource

--      to extract the resource unique key, required

--      to serialize/deserialize it into/from a String, required

--      to define the prefix used for default persistence in files (if prefix have "/", a folder will be created)

-- OPTINONAL:

--      to read the resource from the physical storage, (default provided in file)

--      to store it  (default provided)

--      to delete the resource from the physical storage. (default provided)

        -- other definable methods: readResource, writeResource delResource. here the default persistence in files are used
        
-- buy is the operation to be performed in the example

--4 withResources gets a partial definition of each resource necessary for extracting the key, 
--fill all the rest of the data structures (if found ) and return a list of Maybe Data. 
--BuyIt is part of the domain problem. it receive this list and generates a new list of 
--data objects that are updated in the cache. buyIt is executed atomically.
